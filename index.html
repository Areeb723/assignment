<p id="head">WELCOME TO THE <br>
    BORED APE YACHT CLUB</p>

    <p>BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital 
        collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape 
        doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to
         members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE
          BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and perks
           can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.</p>

            <h1>THE SPECS</h1>
            <p>Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically generated from over 170 possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, and more. All apes are dope, but some are rarer than others.</p>
            <p>The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS. <a href=""> (See Record and Proof.)</a> Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.</p>
            <p>To access members-only areas such as <a href=""> THE BATHROOM </a> , Apeholders will need to be signed into their Metamask Wallet.</p>

        <p id="ag">When you buy a Bored Ape, you’re not simply buying an avatar or a provably-rare piece of art. You are gaining membership access to a club whose benefits and offerings will increase over time. Your Bored Ape can serve as your digital identity, and open digital doors for you.</p>

            <h1><b>THE BATHROOM</b></h1>
            <p>The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale period is over. It contains a canvas accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape. Like any good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw, scrawl, or write expletives.</p>
            <p>Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall every fifteen minutes. Think of it as a collaborative art experiment for the cryptosphere. A members-only canvas for the discerning minds of crypto twitter.</p>
            <p>We're pretty sure it's going to be full of dicks.</p>
